sealed primitive class ::Std::Time::Span < Value

		##[
			Parses a time span string and creates a `Time::Span` value.
			The string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m".
			Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
