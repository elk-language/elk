##[
	Represents the elapsed time between two Times as an int64 nanosecond count.
	 The representation limits the largest representable duration to approximately 290 years.

sealed primitive class ::Std::Duration

		##[
			Parses a duration string and creates a Duration value.
			 A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m".
			Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
